### Cleaning up
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Before we begin, let us clean up the environment and set a working directory. 
This will clear all the variables and start fresh. 
If you want to follow on, then we suggest you to run the 
following lines. 

```{r CleanSetRoot, eval = FALSE}
setwd("H:/2017/BTEP1-TidyingData")
rm(list = ls())
```

### Loading the libraries

Let us first load the libraries needed for the workshop
```{r loadlibraries, results = "hide" }
# if you dont have tidyverse then run the following line once 
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "knitr"))
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(lubridate)
```

### Quick tour of RStudio
We will be using RStudio as the main software for the workshp. 
Let us do a quick live tour of RStudio. We will cover the following useful options accessible through RStudio: 

#### Tools
- Pane (View --> Pane); Option that we are using is "Console on Right"
- Tools --> Install Packages
- Tools --> Global Options
- Session --> Set Working Directory
- Optons --> R Session 
- File --> Import DataSet


![](Images/RStudioIntro.png)

### Getting the data in R via RStudio

Let us introduce R/R-Studio Data Import with a Import Dataset and Command-line options


![](Images/RS-ImportDataset.png)


The following few lines will explain how to read in a data file via R command-line

Please note that we will be using **readr** function for this section. 
Note that **read_csv** is different than **read.csv** 

- read_csv(), read_csv2()  
- Note that read_csv2 and read_csv are same except for what options are default
- The returning objects from read_csv and read.csv are different (DF vs tibbles)
- Other read functions, read_tsv() and read_delim()

## Let us do some examples to compare <span style="color:blue">read.csv</span> and <span style="color:red">read_csv</span> R functions


Watch out how the column names are displayed and additional information 
that you get from <span style="color:red">read_csv</span>. 
Also note that the number of rows are displayed in
<span style="color:blue">read.csv</span> compared to <span style="color:red">read_csv</span> 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
(tcsv <- read.csv("Data/WHO-2a.csv"))  # traditional csv object
(ncsv <- read_csv("Data/WHO-2a.csv"))  # new csv, tibble object

```

See the difference in the returning objects' class. 
We will return to the data.frame and tbl_df later.

```{r}
class(ncsv) # traditional csv function, read.csv 
class(tcsv) # tidyverse read_csv
```

How to read a dataset that has some metadata (indicated by \# ) as the first line followed by the column names?

```{r}
read_csv("Data/WHO-2a.csv", comment = "#")
```

### Why do we insist on using readr::read_csv than read.csv?

- Speed (~ 10x)
- Output from readr is Tibbles (we will expand on this later)
- Base R taps into OS where it is executed. But readr functions are OS independent and
  hence reproducible


 

you can get and set a working directory by the following commands: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd()
setwd("YOUR_DIR"")
```


#### SessionInfo 
Main development in R happens via packages. There are several hundred packages and the number is growing every day. 
Let us find out how many packages are there. 

```{r}
head(available.packages(repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"))
```

To get a detailed description of the attached packages and R session, use 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

### R basics

- R is a language? 
- Dynamic programming language
- Do not need compilation.
- Different from other languages such as C, modern Fortran, Java that require compilation

### Availability 
- Base R and R core packages can be downloaded from 
- Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)
- Available in Windows/Linux/Mac0
- cran.r-project.org 
- How to interact with R? 
- RGUI RStudio (preferred for the class) 

### RStudio basics 

- RStudio is a RGUI
- It started that way, now it is much more than a GUI
- R is the main program 


### Data types in R
- six basic types of atomic vectors:
- doubles, integers, characters, logicals, complex, and raw
- last two are not very important and we will not discuss further

```{r}
complex(1,2)
raw(2) # bytes of numbers
```

#### Integer variables
```{r}
ia <- 1L 
ia1 <- 1
class(ia)
typeof(ia)

class(ia1)
typeof(ia1)
```

#### Double variables

```{r}
ra <- runif(10)
typeof(ra)
class(ra)
```

#### Character variables

```{r}
ca <- c("Tom", "cat")
typeof(ca)
class(ca)
```

#### Let us talk about attributes
```{r}
ia <- 1L 
names(ia) <- "id"
ia
```

#### Other types, matrix
```{r}
M <- matrix(1:6, 3, 2)
dim(M)
args(matrix)
```

#### R as a simple calculator

2 * 3  

if R doesnt recognize a code, it displays a + and waits for you 
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
2 *  
```

Run the following line. you will get an error message. Why?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
10 % 5   
```

### Everything is a vector object in R
- Variable names should not contain number, no underscore etc. 
- Don't mix numbers and character in a vector
   - If you mix data types (coersion; un-expected outcomes)

```{r}
aa <- 22.7

aa = 1 # DO not use not standard

aa + 2
sqrt(aa+1)
aa/3

ages<-c(1,2,3,4) # another way to create vectors
ages

ages+3   # ages of kids after 3 years 
         # scalar is a zero vector
ages
 
```

RStudio environment pane displayes the stored variables

### What are acceptable and non acceptable variable names in R ?

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
No = c("1run", "b$", "^mean", "!var1" )
Yes = c("run1", "b", "mean", "var1")
df <- data_frame(No, Yes)
kable(df, caption = "Acceptable (Yes) and non-acceptable (No) Variable Names")
```

### Variable names are case-sensitive and can be over-written 

```{r}
var1 <- 2
VAR1 <- 1 
(var1 <- 100) # overwrite 
```

### List the variables
Hint: You can also use the Global Environment pane in RStudio for extracting this information
```{r}
ls() # to see what variables you have so far
list.files()  # to see the list of files
```

### For the following section, let us use a 6-sided die and do some Data analysis. 
First let us create a die object
```{r}
die <- 1:6 # 6 sided die
```

### Let us do some Math with our Die

Notice the vector math
```{r}
die + 2
die/2

die * die
```

### Let us watch out for recycling
```{r}
die + 1:2
```


### Let us explore built-in functions using our Die 

```{r}
sum(die)
mean(die)
```

### How to get help in R?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sum
```

### Stored constants
```{r}
pi # not PI
```

### let us round numbers
```{r}
round(pi, 10) # what happened here
round(pi, 2)
round(pi, digits = 9)
```

 

### How to find the arguments for a built-in function?
```{r}
args(round)
args(plot)
```

### <span style="color:green">R-basic Exercise-1</span>

- Find out what the function sample does?
let us sample a die by rolling 3 times in R.

#### What is the issue with the following command?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sample(die, size = 7)
```

### Can we change the default of sample function? 
```{r}
p <- c(rep(0.01,5), 0.95)
sample(x = die, size = 10, replace = TRUE, prob = p)
```


### Do we always have to use the arguments name? What if we dont? 
```{r}
sample(die, 10, replace = TRUE)
sample(die, 10, TRUE) #  define them explicitely
sample(x = die, size = 6, replace = TRUE)
```

### Let us roll the die multiple times
```{r}
# First roll
sample(x = die, size = 2, replace = TRUE) # def prob
# one more roll
sample(x = die, size = 2, replace = TRUE) # def prob
```

### Random numbers
```{r}
unif_rand <- runif(10)
args(round)
```


### Function in R

- Function constructor (like C++) has three parts
- a) name 
- b) body (of code)
- c) arguments 
- function() {  ### }

### Let us build a function
```{r}
dist <- function(a, b) {
  distsq <- sum( (b - a)^2 )
  sqrt(distsq)
}
```
Let us call the function with inputs

```{r}
a <- c(1,2)
b <- c(3,3)

dist(a,b)
```

### Now let us turn the following lines into a function in RStudio

```{r}
#Use RStudio to turn the following line into a function called dist2

distsq <- sum( (b - a)^2 )
sqrt(distsq)

```

### Installing and using packages in R

- R comes with core packages (basic). There are several 
  packages available for R (Ex. Tidyverse)
- How can I install a package? 
<code>install.packages("foreign") # to install foreign package </code>
- After installation, you have load the package, using the following command
<pre> <code> 
library(foreign) 
help(package=foreign)
</code> </pre>

After using a package, use <pre>detach(foreign)</pre> to remove a package (ex. foreign package) from the workspace.

Use <pre> SessionInfo() </pre> to get a detailed description of the attached packages and R session. R commands can be either typed or loaded from a file
using source command. 

Here is an example of installing a package called randomForest and updating package(s)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("randomForest")
library(randomForest)
## multiple packages
update.packages(c("randomForest","tidyverse"))

```

### Debugging in R 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mysum <- function(a,b) {
  sum( (bb - a)^2 )
}

dist <- function(a, b) {
  distsq <- mysum(a,b)
  sqrt(distsq)
}

# use of RStudio bebug or traceback function
dist(a,b)
```


### plots 
Here we will explore the basic plots in R. Watch out for future graphics workshop using R, where we will explore the new and powerful ggplot function
For now, we will focus on simple plots.
```{r}
x <- runif(1000)
hist(x)
hist(x, main = "Histogram of Uniform Random Numbers")
boxplot(x, col = "red")
```

###Read and Write, compressed file
write.csv(lcancer, file = bzfile("data/lcaner.csv.bz2"), row.names = FALSE)

### Some useful functions

Let us use the cars dataset to show some important R commands

```{r}
summary(cars)
str(cars)
```

### Single bracket
```{r}
cars[1,]
cars[1:5,]
cars[1,]
cars[,1] # vector
class(cars[,1])
class(cars)
nrow(cars)
length(cars$speed)
min_speed <- min(cars$speed)
min_speed
max(cars$speed)
cars[min_speed,] # can be easily done using dplyr
filter(cars, speed > 20)
```
### Accessing values in data frames

```{r}
names(cars)
cars$speed # vector
cars$dist 
```

If you noticed that data.frame has unique data type for each column.
If I want to create an object with mixed types. What I need is a list

```{r}
mylist <- list(a = 1:10, b = LETTERS[1:10], c = 11:20L)
mylist
mylist[[1]]
mylist$a
```


### Not commonly used data types
```{r}
INF<-3/0 # Inf or -Inf 
-3/0 
#diff between Inf and NA (not a number) 
!is.na(Inf)

# what is then Inf?
is.finite(INF)
is.infinite(INF)
```


###coercion
```{r}
x<-seq(1:10)
x
sum(x) # 55
sum(x>5) # 5
#why? coercion
x>5  # logical T or F
# sum them 
sum(x>5) # you get 5 sum of  5 1s 
#if you want the sum of their values

sum(x[x>5])
```

### some very useful functions

-apply, lapply, sapply and tapply

#### apply

- apply operates on arrays (2D, 3D; ex matrices)
```{r}
# let us construct a 6 x 5 matrix
X <- matrix(rnorm(30), nrow=6, ncol=5 )

#or
#X <- (rnorm(30), 6, 5 )
# I prefer the previous form
```

If we want to sum up the columns, you can use apply function. 
Let us first learn the syntax of the function by typing 
<span style="color:red">?apply</span>
```{r}
apply(X, 2, sum)
```

### <span style="color:green">Apply Exercise-1</span>

- What object do you get back from apply function? Explore the question using the previous example.

#### lapply

- input objects for lapply could be DF, lists or vectors 
- output is always a list


```{r}
A <- matrix(rnorm(30), nrow=6, ncol=5 ) 
B <- matrix(rnorm(20), nrow=2, ncol=10 ) 
C <- matrix(rnorm(36), nrow=6, ncol=6 ) 

MyList <- list(A, B, C)
```

To sum up all the columns in each of the matrices, we can write a code 
like shown below

```{r}
# Note the "[" is a separator
# The following line extracts first row from all matrices
lapply(MyList,"[",2, 1)
```
##### sapply

- sapply() is the cleaned-up (s:simplify) version of apply function 
- Also sapply() is just a wrapper to lapply() 

Let us do the same lapply() function above

```{r}
sapply(MyList,"[", 2, 1, simplify= F) # returns a List

sapply(MyList,"[", 2, 1, simplify= T) # returns a vector
```

#### tapply

Let us use tapply on mpg dataset from ggplot2
```{r}
tapply(mpg$hwy, mpg$cyl, mean)
```


#### Related function to apply() function. 
NEED TO FILL IN 


#Finally Cleaning up

```{r, eval = FALSE }
objects() # what vars do you have in your env
search() #what is attached
#to remove, use rm(object)
detach(dataframe) 
```


In the tidyverse the commonly returning objects are not data.frame but tibbles.
So, let us introduce tibble in this section. 

## Tibble

What is tibble?

- modern way or loooking at the traditional data.frame 
- you will get a lot more useful information than the data.frames
- tibble is part of tibble package and part of the core tidyverse package
 
To get help, use 
```{r, tibblehelp, eval=FALSE}
?tibble
vignette("tibble")

```

 
How to create a tibble? 
```{r create-tibble}
tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = LETTERS[1:5], 
  z = x^2 + 20
)

```
What is the difference between the R regular data.frame and 
tibble (data_frame)?

```{r TibblevsDataframe}
employee <- c('John Wayne','Peter Doe','Esther Julie')
salary <- c(20000, 23400, 26800)
startdate <- as.Date(c('2016-12-1','2007-3-25','2016-3-14'))
df <- data.frame(employee, salary, startdate)
df

as_tibble(df)

```

Let us create a data.frame and a tibble. 

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame( Color = "Red")
tb1 <-tibble(Color = "Red")
```

### <span style="color:green">Tibble Exercise-1</span>

If you type the following commmands, what will you get and 
explain your reasoning:

```{r, eval = F}
df1$C
tb1$C

class(df1$Color)
class(tb1$Color)
```

Also, speculate on the type of object that you will get from 
each of these above two operations? 

The above explains traditional R data.frame is helpful in 
filling in the missing information. Also how data.frame modifies
the variable type without asking (ex Character to Factor)


## Where can this go?

purr::map_dbl(mtcars, mean)
purrr:map_dbl(mtcars, mean)

tb1 <- as.tibble( Color = "red")
tb1$C  


you can coerce regular R data frame into tibble. Let us look at the R dataset, cars.
Let us learn about cars datset 

<pre> <code>
  ?cars
</code></pre>

Let us find out what class cars object belongs to and how to convert cars data frame into
tibbles object. Note that 

```{r coerce-tibble}
class(cars)
as_tibble(cars)
head(cars) #otherwise you get all 50 rows
```

## Why Tibble? 

- Tibble doesnt change the inputs. Ex. strings to factors 
- Doesnt add new names or modify the inputs
- For example, Tibble never converts strings to factors

## What is tribble

- transposed tibble, tribble()
- small data in readable form
- column headings are shown as formulas ( ie ~ )
- nice format
- no need to explicitely use head command (Ex. head cars)


```{r}
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  "Male", 187, 210,
  "Female", 190, 150
)
```

Let us create a little bit complicated tibble 
note that lubridate gives the current time

```{r complicatedtibble, results= 'asis'}
t2 <- tibble(
  a = lubridate::now() + runif(1e3) * 86400,
  b = lubridate::today() + runif(1e3) * 30,
  c = 1:1e3,
  d = runif(1e3),
  e = sample(letters, 1e3, replace = TRUE)
)
```


```{r}
t2
```

You can change the defaults of tibble display with options.

```{r}
options(tibble.print_max = 10, tibble.print_min = 6)
t2
```

You can also use the following tibble option to show all columns
```{r, eval=FALSE}
options(tibble.width = Inf)
# more options available at 
package?tibble
```


How to extract the columns or rows of tibble?

```{r}
head(t2$a)

has_name(t2, "b")
getOption("tibble.max_extra_cols")
```

how to add a row of a tibble in a specific place?

original t2 
```{r}
t2
```

```{r ,results='as.is'}
    aa = lubridate::today()
    bb = lubridate::now()
    cc = 1:1
    dd = runif(1)
    ee = sample(letters, 1, replace = TRUE)
    print(aa); print(bb); print(cc); print(dd); print(ee)
t2 %>% 
  add_row(
    a = aa, 
    b = bb,
    c = cc,
    d = dd,
    e = ee, .before = 2  # note the dot in ".before = 2"
)

```
After the change

```{r}
t2
```

## Subsetting 

- \$ by name
-    

```{r}

df <- tibble(
  x = runif(5),
  y = rnorm(5)
)

df$x

df[[1]]
```

Can you use Tibble in a pipeline?

```{r}
df %>% .$x   

df %>% .[["y"]]
```

What happens if tibble doesnt work with a package? 
Transform Tibble back to a data.frame using the following command:
```{r}
as.data.frame(df)
```


### <span style="color:green">Tibble Exercise-2</span>

Create a new tibble with the following information:
  name, age, height, weight, smoker (T or F), Male (True or Fale)
 compare the tibble with the R data_frame


### <span style="color:green">Tibble Exercise-3</span>

convert iris data set (given to us in data.frame ) to tibble data_frame


### <span style="color:green">Tibble Exercise-4</span>

How can you tell whether the object is a Tibble or not? 

### <span style="color:green">Tibble Exercise-5 (based on Hadley's tutorial) </span>

Partial matching is a big issue with data.frame.
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x
df[, "xyz"]


### <span style="color:green">Final R-basic exercise</span>

The datset that we will be using for this section comes from the  
National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)
https://www.cpsc.gov/research--statistics/neiss-injury-data 
Here is a short description of the data file from the NEISS. 

*"Each record (case) is separated by a carriage return/line feed, and the
fields (parameters and narrative) are separated by a tab character, which you can specify as the delimiter when importing into a spreadsheet or database."*

Before you read in the data, please take a look at the following two files: **NEISS_SAS_formats.txt** and **NEISS_SAS_variance.txt** 
These two files will act as the codebook for the data. 

Read the data file, **nss15.tsv** file from the sub-folder/directory, **Data** and call the data as **nss15** variable.

**Hint:** Use the File --> Import --> Data DataSet option to read the file. 
To remind the data is in a tab-separated format.

**Hint:** Watch out for the Data Type choices that are suggested to you and choose the appropriate ones

**Hint:** Please watch out for any warnings or issues while R/Rstudio 
is reading the files. If you spot any errors, think of how to fix it.
After fixing the problems (if any), go back and read the file. 
 
Answer the following questions.

- How many cases are reported in this dataset?
- How many covariates this dataset has? 
- Access CPSC Case # 150620565 and report the following things:
  What is the age of the patient? 
  What is the Race, weight, Stratum, Sex, Race and Diagnosis
- How many are more than 100 years old?  
- How many cases were taken to **Children's Hospital**?
  From the reported cases, get the CPSC case number and age for the 20th entry.
- Report the number of cases for the month of May? 
  Tell us how many cases were reported for May 13 - May 16, 2015? 
  Use this information to answer the following questions. 
- What hospitals were the cases went to (provide a table)?
- How many were children ( < 5 years)? 
- provide the proportion of male/female? 
- What was the race distribution? 
 
### Ignore from here to the end for the moment


## Hands-on exercise using Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset

Now, let us read a slightly complicated Breast Cancer dataset. First let us use
the import data set drop-down option 

![](Images/RS-ImportDataset.png)
![](Images/RS-ImportDataset1.png)
```{r readdata}
#wdbc <- read_csv("C:/Users/Ravi/Desktop/BTEP/Data/wdbc.data", col_names = FALSE)

wdbc <- read_csv("Data/wdbc.data", col_names = FALSE)
#wdbctry2 <- read_csv("C:/Users/Ravi/Desktop/BTEP/Data/wdbc.data", header = FALSE)
names(wdbc)
```

Let us add column names

```{r AssignColnams}
cnames <- c("ID", "Diagnosis", 
            "radius", "Texture", "Perimeter", "area",
            "smoothness", "compactness", "concavity", "concave_points",
            "symmetry","fractaldim",
            "radiusSE", "TextureSE", "PerimeterSE", "areaSE",
            "smoothnessSE", "compactnessSE", "concavitySE", "concave_pointsSE",
            "symmetrySE","fractaldimSE",
            "radiusW", "TextureW", "PerimeterW", "areaW",
            "smoothnessW", "compactnessW", "concavityW", "concave_pointsW",
            "symmetryW","fractaldimW")

names(wdbc) <- cnames
```
 Let us find out how many samples we have in the dataset? 
 
 
```{r}
nrow(wdbc)
```
How many covariates are in the dataset? 
We can look at the Global environment (top right) window to get the information
We can also find that out by typing the following command:
```{r}
ncol(wdbc)
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r cars, fig.cap = "cars"}
with(cars, plot(speed,dist))
```
