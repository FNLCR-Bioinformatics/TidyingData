### Cleaning up
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Let us clean up the environment and set a working directory. 
This will clear all the variables and start fresh. If you want to 
follow on, then we suggest you to run the 
following line. 

```{r CleanSetRoot, eval = FALSE}
setwd("H:/2017/BTEP1-TidyingData")
rm(list = ls())
```

### Loading the libraries

Let us first load the libraries needed for the workshop
```{r loadlibraries}
# if you dont have tidyverse then run the following line once 
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "knitr"))
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

### Quick tour of RStudio
We will be using RStudio as the main software for the workshp. 
Let us do a quick live tour of RStudio. We will cover the following useful tools accessible throug RStudio. 

#### Tools
- Pane (View --> Pane); Option that we are using is "Console on Right"
- Tools --> Install Packages
- Tools --> Global Options
- Session --> Set Working Directory
- Optons --> R Session 
- File --> Import DataSet


![](Images/RStudioIntro.png)

### Getting the data inside R via RStudio

Let us introduce R/R-Studio Data Import with a Import Dataset and Command-line options


![](Images/RS-ImportDataset.png)


The following few lines will explain how to read in a data file via R command-line

Please note that we will be using **readr** function for this section. 
Note that read_csv is different than read.csv 

- read_csv(), read_csv2()  # read_csv2 and read_csv are same except for what options are default
- the returning objects from read_csv and read.csv are different (DF vs tibbles)
- read_tsv() 
- read_delim()

## Let us do some examples


Watch out how the column names are displayed and additional information 
that you get from read_csv
Also note the number of rows are displayed in read_csv compared to read.csv

```{r, echo = TRUE}
(tcsv <- read.csv("Data/WHO-2a.csv"))  # traditional csv object
(ncsv <- read_csv("Data/WHO-2a.csv"))  # new csv, tibble object

```

See the difference in the returning objects' class. 
We will return to the data.frame and tbl_df later.

```{r}
class(ncsv) # traditional csv function, read.csv 
class(tcsv) # tidyverse read_csv
```

What happens if your dataset has a metadata (indicated by \# ) as the first line followed by the column names

```{r}
read_csv("Data/WHO-2a.csv", comment = "#")
```

### Why we insist on using readr::read_csv than read.csv?

- Speed (~ 10x)
- Output from readr is Tibbles (we will expand on this later)
- Base R taps into OS where it is executed. But readr functions are OS independent and
  hence reproducible
  
### Import Exercise-1 (Hint: To find out where you are, use the getwd command) 
For this exercise, we will be using the data set, nss15.tsv, downloaded from
https://www.cpsc.gov

you can get and set a working directory by the following commands: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd()
setwd("YOUR_DIR"")
```


## To get a detailed description of the attached packages and R session 

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

### R basics

- R is a language? 
- Dynamic programming language
- Do not need compilation.
- Different from other languages such as C, modern Fortran, Java that require compilation

### Availability 
- Base R and R core packages can be downloaded from 
- Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)
- Available in Windows/Linux/Mac0
- cran.r-project.org 
- How to interact with R? 
- RGUI RStudio (preferred for the class) 

### RStudio basics 

- RStudio is a RGUI
- It started that way, now it is much more than a GUI
- R is the main program 

### simple calculator

2 * 3  

if R doesnt recognize a code, it displays a + and waits for you 

type the following in command prompt, you will get a error message. 
Explain why you 
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
2 *  
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
- run the following line. you will get an error message. Why? 
Error: unexpected input in "10 % 5" 

10 % 5 
```

### Everything is an vector object in R
- Variable names should not contain number, no underscore etc. 
- Don't mix numbers and character in a vector
   - If you mix coercion (un expected outcomes)

```{r}
aa <- 22.7

aa = 1 # DO not use not standard

aa + 2
sqrt(aa+1)
aa/3

ages<-c(1,2,3,4) # another way to create vectors
ages

ages+3   # ages of kids after 3 years 
         # scalar is a zero vector
ages
 
```


RStudio environment pane now displays the variable.

### What are acceptable and not acceptable variable names

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
No = c("1run", "b$", "^mean", "!var1" )
Yes = c("run1", "b", "mean", "var1")
df <- data_frame(No, Yes)
kable(df, caption = "Acceptable (Yes) and non-acceptable (No) Variable Names")
```

### Variable names are case-sensitive and can be 
    over-written 

```{r}
var1 <- 2
VAR1 <- 1 
(var1 <- 100) # overwrite 
```

### List the variables (you can also use the Global Environment pane in RStudio for this)
```{r}
ls() # to see what variables you have so far
list.files()  # to see the list of files
```

# Data analysis without a die? 
```{r}
die <- 1:6 # 6 sided die
```

# Math with die

Notice the vector math
```{r}
die + 2
die/2

die * die
```

### Let us watch out for recycling in
```{r}
die + 1:2
```


### Built-in function 

```{r}
sum(die)
mean(die)
```

### How to get help in R?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?sum
```

### Stored constants
```{r}
pi # not PI
```

### let us round numbers
```{r}
round(pi, 10) # what happened here
round(pi, 2)
round(pi, digits = 9)
```

 

### How to find the arguments for a built-in function 
```{r}
args(round)
args(plot)
```

### Exercise 2: Find out what the function sample does?
let us sample a die by rolling 3 times

### What is the issue with the following command?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sample(die, size = 7)
```

### Can we change the default of sample function? 
```{r}
p <- c(rep(0.01,5), 0.95)
sample(x = die, size = 10, replace = TRUE, prob = p)
```


### Do we always have to use the arguments name? What if we dont? 
```{r}
sample(die, 10, replace = TRUE)
sample(die, 10, TRUE) #  define them explicitely
sample(x = die, size = 6, replace = TRUE)
```

### Let us roll the die multiple times
```{r}
# First roll
sample(x = die, size = 2, replace = TRUE) # def prob
# one more roll
sample(x = die, size = 2, replace = TRUE) # def prob
```

### Random numbers
```{r}
unif_rand <- runif(10)
args(round)
```


### Function in R

- Function constructor (like C++) has three parts
- a) name 
- b) body (of code)
- c) arguments 
- function() {  ### }

### Let us build a function
```{r}
dist <- function(a, b) {
  distsq <- sum( (b - a)^2 )
  sqrt(distsq)
}
```
Let us call the function with inputs

```{r}
a <- c(1,2)
b <- c(3,3)

dist(a,b)
```

### Now let us turn the following lines into a function in RStudion

```{r}
#Use RStudio to turn the following line into a function called dist2

distsq <- sum( (b - a)^2 )
sqrt(distsq)

```

### Installing and using packages in R

- R comes with core packages (basic). There are several 
  packages available for R (Ex. Tidyverse)
- How can I install a package? 
<code>install.packages("foreign") # to install foreign package </code>
- After installation, you have load the package, using the following command
<pre> <code> 
library(foreign) 
help(package=foreign)
</code> </pre>

After using a package, use <pre>detach(foreign)</pre> to remove a package (ex. foreign package) from the workspace.

Use <pre> SessionInfo() </pre> to get a detailed description of the attached packages and R session. R commands can be either typed or loaded from a file
using source command. 

Here is an example of installing a package called randomForest and updating package(s)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("randomForest")
library(randomForest)
## multiple packages
update.packages(c("randomForest","tidyverse"))

```

### Debugging in R 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mysum <- function(a,b) {
  sum( (bb - a)^2 )
}

dist <- function(a, b) {
  distsq <- mysum(a,b)
  sqrt(distsq)
}

# use of RStudio bebug or traceback function
dist(a,b)
```


### Data types in R
- six basic types of atomic vectors:
- doubles, integers, characters, logicals, complex, and raw
- last two are not very important and we will not discuss further

```{r}
complex(1,2)
raw(2) # bytes of numbers
```

### Integer variables
```{r}
ia <- 1L 
ia1 <- 1
class(ia)
typeof(ia)

class(ia1)
typeof(ia1)
```

### Double variables

```{r}
ra <- runif(10)
typeof(ra)
class(ra)
```

### Character variables

```{r}
ca <- c("Tom", "cat")
typeof(ca)
class(ca)
```

### Let us talk about attributes
```{r}
ia <- 1L 
names(ia) <- "id"
ia
```

### Other types, matrix
```{r}
M <- matrix(1:6, 3, 2)
dim(M)
args(matrix)
```

### plots 

```{r}
x <- runif(1000)
hist(x)
hist(x, main = "Histogram of Uniform Random Numbers")
boxplot(x, col = "red")
```

###Read and Write, compressed file
write.csv(lcancer, file = bzfile("data/lcaner.csv.bz2"), row.names = FALSE)

### Some useful functions

Let us use the cars dataset to show some important R commands

```{r}
summary(cars)
str(cars)
```

### Single bracket
```{r}
cars[1,]
cars[1:5,]
cars[1,]
cars[,1] # vector
class(cars[,1])
class(cars)
nrow(cars)
length(cars$speed)
min_speed <- min(cars$speed)
min_speed
max(cars$speed)
cars[min_speed,] # can be easily done using dplyr
filter(cars, speed > 10)
```
### Accessing values in data frames

```{r}
names(cars)
cars$speed # vector
cars$dist 
```

If you noticed that data.frame has unique data type for each column.
If I want to create an object with mixed types. What I need is a list

```{r}
mylist <- list(a = 1:10, b = LETTERS[1:10], c = 11:20L)
mylist
mylist[[1]]
mylist$a
```


### Not commonly used data types
```{r}
INF<-3/0 # Inf or -Inf 
-3/0 
#diff between Inf and NA (not a number) 
!is.na(Inf)

# what is then Inf?
is.finite(INF)
is.infinite(INF)
```


###coercion
```{r}
x<-seq(1:10)
x
sum(x) # 55
sum(x>5) # 5
#why? coercion
x>5  # logical T or F
# sum them 
sum(x>5) # you get 5 sum of  5 1s 
#if you want the sum of their values

sum(x[x>5])
```

### some very useful functions

-tapply, sapply, lapply



#Finally Cleaning up

```{r, eval = FALSE }
objects() # what vars do you have in your env
search() #what is attached
#to remove, use rm(object)
detach(dataframe) 
```


In the tidyverse the commonly returning objects are not data.frame but tibbles.
So, let us introduce tibble in this section. 

## Tibble

What is tibble?

- modern way or loooking at the traditional data.frame 
- you will get a lot more useful information than the data.frames
- tibble is part of tibble package and part of the core tidyverse package
 
To get help, use 
```{r, tibblehelp, eval=FALSE}
?tibble
vignette("tibble")

```

 
How to create a tibble? 
```{r create-tibble}
tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = LETTERS[1:5], 
  z = x^2 + 20
)

```
What is the difference between the R regular data.frame and 
tibble (data_frame)?

```{r TibblevsDataframe}
employee <- c('John Wayne','Peter Doe','Esther Julie')
salary <- c(20000, 23400, 26800)
startdate <- as.Date(c('2016-12-1','2007-3-25','2016-3-14'))
df <- data.frame(employee, salary, startdate)
df

as_tibble(df)

```

Let us create a data.frame and a tibble. 

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame( Color = "Red")
tb1 <-tibble(Color = "Red")
```

## Exercise: 

If you type the following commmands, what will you get and 
explain your reasoning:

```{r}
df1$C
tb1$C

class(df1$Color)
class(tb1$Color)
```

Also, speculate on the type of object that you will get from 
each of these above two operations? 

The above explains traditional R data.frame is helpful in 
filling in the missing information. Also how data.frame modifies
the variable type without asking (ex Character to Factor)


## Where can this go?

purr::map_dbl(mtcars, mean)
purrr:map_dbl(mtcars, mean)

tb1 <- as.tibble( Color = "red")
tb1$C  


you can coerce regular R data frame into tibble. Let us look at the R dataset, cars.
Let us learn about cars datset 

<pre> <code>
  ?cars
</code></pre>

Let us find out what class cars object belongs to and how to convert cars data frame into
tibbles object. Note that 

```{r coerce-tibble}
class(cars)
as_tibble(cars)
head(cars) #otherwise you get all 50 rows
```

## Why Tibble? 

- Tibble doesnt change the inputs. Ex. strings to factors 
- Doesnt add new names or modify the inputs
- For example, Tibble never converts strings to factors

## What is tribble

- transposed tibble, tribble()
- small data in readable form
- column headings are shown as formulas ( ie ~ )
- nice format
- no need to explicitely use head command (Ex. head cars)


```{r}
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  "Male", 187, 210,
  "Female", 190, 150
)
```

Let us create a little bit complicated tibble 
note that lubridate gives the current time

```{r complicatedtibble, results= 'asis'}
t2 <- tibble(
  a = lubridate::now() + runif(1e3) * 86400,
  b = lubridate::today() + runif(1e3) * 30,
  c = 1:1e3,
  d = runif(1e3),
  e = sample(letters, 1e3, replace = TRUE)
)
```


```{r}
t2
```

You can change the defaults of tibble display with options.

```{r}
options(tibble.print_max = 10, tibble.print_min = 6)
t2
```

You can also use the following tibble option to show all columns
```{r, eval=FALSE}
options(tibble.width = Inf)
# more options available at 
package?tibble
```


How to extract the columns or rows of tibble?

```{r}
head(t2$a)

has_name(t2, "b")
getOption("tibble.max_extra_cols")
```

how to add a row of a tibble in a specific place?

original t2 
```{r}
t2
```

```{r ,results='as.is'}
    aa = lubridate::today()
    bb = lubridate::now()
    cc = 1:1
    dd = runif(1)
    ee = sample(letters, 1, replace = TRUE)
    print(aa); print(bb); print(cc); print(dd); print(ee)
t2 %>% 
  add_row(
    a = aa, 
    b = bb,
    c = cc,
    d = dd,
    e = ee, .before = 2  # note the dot in ".before = 2"
)

```
After the change

```{r}
t2
```

## Subsetting 

- \$ by name
-    

```{r}

df <- tibble(
  x = runif(5),
  y = rnorm(5)
)

df$x

df[[1]]
```

Can you use Tibble in a pipeline?

```{r}
df %>% .$x   

df %>% .[["y"]]
```

What happens if tibble doesnt work with a package? 
Transform Tibble back to a data.frame using the following command:
```{r}
as.data.frame(df)
```


## Tibble Exercise 1

Create a new tibble with the following information:
  name, age, height, weight, smoker (T or F), Male (True or Fale)
 compare the tibble with the R data_frame


## Exercise 2

convert iris data set (given to us in data.frame ) to tibble data_frame


## Exercise 3

How can you tell whether the object is a Tibble or not? 

## Exercise 4 (based on Wickam's book)

Partial matching is a big issue with data.frame.
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x
df[, "xyz"]


### Hands-on Exercise

The datset that we will be using comes from the  
National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)
https://www.cpsc.gov/research--statistics/neiss-injury-data 
Here is a short description of the data file from the NEISS. 

*"Each record (case) is separated by a carriage return/line feed, and the
fields (parameters and narrative) are separated by a tab character, which you can specify as the delimiter when importing into a spreadsheet or database."*

Before you read in the data, please take a look at the following two files: **NEISS_SAS_formats.txt** and **NEISS_SAS_variance.txt** 
These two files will act as the codebook for the data. 

Read the data file, **nss15.tsv** file from the sub-folder/directory, **Data** and call the data as **nss15** variable.

Hint: Use the File --> Import --> Data DataSet option to read the file. 
To remind the data is in a tab-separated format.

Hint: Watch out for the Data Type choices that are suggested to you and choose the appropriate ones

Hint: Please watch out for any warnings or issues while R/Rstudio 
is reading the files. If you spot any errors, think of how to fix it.
After fixing the problems (if any), go back and read the file. 
 
Answer the following questions.

- How many cases are reported in this dataset?
- How many covariates this dataset has? 
- Access CPSC Case # 150620565 and report the following things:
  What is the age of the patient? 
  What is the Race, weight, Stratum, Sex, Race and Diagnosis
- How many are more than 100 years old?  
- How many cases were taken to **Children's Hospital**?
  From the reported cases, get the CPSC case number and age for the 20th entry.
- Report the number of cases for the month of May? 
  Tell us how many cases were reported for May 13 - May 16, 2015? 
  Use this information to answer the following questions. 
  
a) What hospitals were the cases went to (provide a table)?
b) How many were children ( < 5 years)? 
c) provide the proportion of male/female? 
d) What was the race distribution? 
 
 
 
 

## Hands-on exercise using Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset

Now, let us read a slightly complicated Breast Cancer dataset. First let us use
the import data set drop-down option 

![](Images/RS-ImportDataset.png)
![](Images/RS-ImportDataset1.png)
```{r readdata}
#wdbc <- read_csv("C:/Users/Ravi/Desktop/BTEP/Data/wdbc.data", col_names = FALSE)

wdbc <- read_csv("Data/wdbc.data", col_names = FALSE)
#wdbctry2 <- read_csv("C:/Users/Ravi/Desktop/BTEP/Data/wdbc.data", header = FALSE)
names(wdbc)
```

Let us add column names

```{r AssignColnams}
cnames <- c("ID", "Diagnosis", 
            "radius", "Texture", "Perimeter", "area",
            "smoothness", "compactness", "concavity", "concave_points",
            "symmetry","fractaldim",
            "radiusSE", "TextureSE", "PerimeterSE", "areaSE",
            "smoothnessSE", "compactnessSE", "concavitySE", "concave_pointsSE",
            "symmetrySE","fractaldimSE",
            "radiusW", "TextureW", "PerimeterW", "areaW",
            "smoothnessW", "compactnessW", "concavityW", "concave_pointsW",
            "symmetryW","fractaldimW")

names(wdbc) <- cnames
```
 Let us find out how many samples we have in the dataset? 
 
 
```{r}
nrow(wdbc)
```
How many covariates are in the dataset? 
We can look at the Global environment (top right) window to get the information
We can also find that out by typing the following command:
```{r}
ncol(wdbc)
```

## #xtra Ignore for the moment

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r cars, fig.cap = "cars"}
with(cars, plot(speed,dist))
```
