### Cleaning up
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(lubridate)

# pull Examples for citing line number:
examples <- readLines('Examples.R')
```


# Tibbles

In the tidyverse the commonly returning objects are not data.frame but tibbles, which can be created with either the `tibble()` or `data_frame()` functions.

What is tibble?

- modern way of loooking at the traditional data.frame 
- you will get a lot more useful information than the data.frames
- tibble is part of tibble package and part of the core tidyverse package
 
There is a nice vignette for working with tibbles, accessible using this command: `vignette("tibble")`.
 
How to create a tibble? 
```{r create-tibble}
tibble(x = 1:5, 
       y = LETTERS[1:5], 
       z = x^2 + 20)
```

What is the differences between the base-R `data.frame` and `tibble` (`data_frame`)?

```{r tibble vs data frame}
(df <- data.frame(employee = c('John Wayne','Peter Doe','Esther Julie'),
                  salary = c(20000, 23400, 26800), 
                  startdate = as.Date(c('2016-12-1','2007-3-25','2016-3-14'))))

as_tibble(df)
```


## Why Tibbles? 

- `tibble()` doesnt change the inputs (i.e. it doesn't convert strings to factors).

```{r}
data.frame(x = letters[1:5]) %>%
    str() # x converted into a factor

data_frame(x = letters[1:5]) %>%
    str() # no auto-conversion
```

- `tibble()` allows the use of variables within the function, making for neater code.

```{r, error = TRUE}
data.frame(x = 1:10,
           y = x / 2) %>%
    str()  # doesn't work

dat <- data.frame(x = 1:10)
dat$y <- dat$x / 2
str(dat)

data_frame(x = 1:10,
           y = x / 2) %>%
    str()
```

- `data.frame()` does partial string matching without warning you.

```{r}
data.frame(color = "red")$c

data_frame(color = "red")$c
```

- The print method for tibbles is more user friendly.

```{r}
data(who)

who # this is a tibble
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
as.data.frame(who) # try printing as a data.frame (output not shown here)
```

Why not use a tibble? There are a few packages that don't get along with tibbles (e.g. the missForest package). In this case, you may need to convert your tibble into a data.frame using `as.data.frame()`. 

## Working with tibbles

Here is a more complicated tibble, consisting of a random start time within +/- 12 hours of now and a random end time within the next 30 days (where "now" is relative to when this code is run).

```{r complicatedtibble, results= 'asis'}
# lubridate gives us the now() function
require(lubridate)

twelve_hours <- 43200 # seconds
twenty4_hours <- 86400 # seconds

n <- 1000
set.seed(239847)
(t2 <- tibble(
    start   = now() +                      # random time within +/- 12 hours of now
              runif(n, -twelve_hours, twelve_hours), 
    end     = now() +                      # random time within the next 30 days
              runif(n, 1, 30 * twenty4_hours),
    elapsed = as.numeric(end - start, 
                         units = 'hours'), # hours between time_of_day and day
    l       = sample(letters, n, replace = TRUE)  # some letters
))
```

### Adding/changing variables

You can add and change variables within a tibble using `mutate()`. The syntax is nearly identical to `tibble()` and `data_frame()`, except it requires the tibble you want to edit as input. For example, if we want to add a new variable to our data_frame, `t2`:

```{r mutate}
(t2 <- mutate(t2,
              case = 1:n <= 500))
```

### Adding rows

You can add rows to a tibble, and using the `.before` option will allow you to specify where exactly to add the data (default, i.e. if you don't specify `.before`, is to put the new data at the end of the tibble).

```{r add rows}
# see our new row on line 2?
(t2 <- t2 %>%
       add_row(start   = now(),
               end     = now() + 1,
               elapsed = 24,
               l       = 'f',
               .before = 2))
```

### Subsetting

You can use all the same indexing techniques described for data.frames in the [R/RStudio Intro](https://github.com/ravichas/TidyingData/blob/master/0-RStudio-Intro.md), or you can use one of the wrapper functions from the tidyverse:

- filter(): Select specific rows from the `tibble`

```{r filter}
# pull all rows where elapsed number of hours is less than 72
# looks like there are 102 observations (rows) that fit that criterion
filter(t2, elapsed < 72)
```

- select(): Select specific columns from the `tibble`

```{r select}
# pull all start and end times
select(t2, start, end)

# or drop the l column
select(t2, -l)
```

### Printing

You can change the defaults of tibble display with options.

```{r}
tmp <- options()
options(tibble.print_min = 6)
t2

# reset options
options(tmp)
```

You can also use the `tibble.width = Inf` option to print all columns. There are more options documented at `package?tibble`.

# Importing Data

RStudio has a nice data import utility under File > Import Dataset. This will generate the code to repeat the import (i.e. so you can save it to your script).

![](Images/RS-ImportDataset.png)

If you are comfortable with writing the code directly, the following functions will import data into tibbles:

- `?read_csv`: import comma separated values data
- `?read_csv2`: import semicolon separated values data (European version of a csv)
- `?read_tsv`: import tab delimited data
- `?read_delim`: import a text file with data (e.g. space delimted)
- `?read_excel`: import Excel formated data (either xls or xlsx format)

If you are familiar with R you may recognize that there are data.frame generating counterparts from the utils package (e.g. `read.csv()` and `read.delim()`). Why would we want to use these function from the readr package over the base-R functions?

- Speed (~ 10x) - this can make a big difference with very large data sets
- Output from readr is a tibble
- Base R taps into the OS where it is executed, but `readr` functions are OS independent and hence more consistent across platforms

```{r read_csv}
# returns a data.frame
read.csv('Data/WHO-2a.csv')

require(readr)
# returns a tibble
# also, note the helpful warning that several columns have the same name
read_csv('Data/WHO-2a.csv')
```

## Comments/Metadata

Sometimes, there will be extra metadata at the top of a file, often preceded with '#'. How do we read a dataset that has some metadata (indicated by '#')? What if the extra lines aren't properly marked with '#'?

```{r}
# we want to skip this first line
readLines("Data/WHO-2.csv")[1:3]

# ignore metadata row
read_csv("Data/WHO-2.csv", comment = "#")

# this results in identical output, but we specify how many lines to skip
read_csv("Data/WHO-2.csv", skip = 1)
```
