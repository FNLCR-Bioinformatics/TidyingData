### Cleaning up
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Before we begin, let us clean up the environment and set a working directory. 
This will clear all the variables and start fresh. 
If you want to follow on, then we suggest you to run the 
following lines. 

```{r CleanSetRoot, eval = FALSE}
setwd("H:/2017/BTEP1-TidyingData")
rm(list = ls())
```

### Loading the libraries

Let us first load the libraries needed for the workshop
```{r loadlibraries, results = "hide" }
# if you dont have tidyverse then run the following line once 
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "knitr"))
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(lubridate)
```

 

## Hands-on exercise using Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset

Now, let us read a slightly complicated Breast Cancer dataset. First let us use
the import data set drop-down option 

![](Images/RS-ImportDataset.png)
![](Images/RS-ImportDataset1.png)
```{r readdata}
wdbc <- read_csv("Data/wdbc.data", col_names = FALSE)
#wdbctry2 <- read_csv("C:/Users/Ravi/Desktop/BTEP/Data/wdbc.data", header = FALSE)
names(wdbc)
```

Let us add column names

```{r AssignColnams}
cnames <- c("ID", "Diagnosis", 
            "radius", "Texture", "Perimeter", "area",
            "smoothness", "compactness", "concavity", "concave_points",
            "symmetry","fractaldim",
            "radiusSE", "TextureSE", "PerimeterSE", "areaSE",
            "smoothnessSE", "compactnessSE", "concavitySE", "concave_pointsSE",
            "symmetrySE","fractaldimSE",
            "radiusW", "TextureW", "PerimeterW", "areaW",
            "smoothnessW", "compactnessW", "concavityW", "concave_pointsW",
            "symmetryW","fractaldimW")

names(wdbc) <- cnames
```
 Let us find out how many samples we have in the dataset? 
 
 
```{r}
nrow(wdbc)
```
How many covariates are in the dataset? 
We can look at the Global environment (top right) window to get the information
We can also find that out by typing the following command:
```{r}
ncol(wdbc)
```
